# Weekbase

This repository contains a simple webpage for selecting your working hours for each day of the week and generating a musical beat from them. Open `index.html` in a browser and tick the checkboxes for every 30-minute block you work.

Press **Create Beat** to start a loop that plays a short beep for each
checked half-hour slot. Use the **Stop** button to end the loop.
